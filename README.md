# Parasitic_Egg_Multiclass_Object_Detection_and_Counting_in_Microscopic_Images

## Background & Problem Statement
Parasitic infections have been recognized as one of the most significant causes of illnesses by WHO. Diarrheal disease, which is often caused by parasitic infection is the TOP 5 leading cause of children death in low-income countries.

Diagnosis of intestinal parasites is usually based on direct microscopic examination, which require trained/skilled personnel that often lacking in remote region.

THAT IS WHY we need a new tool for diagnosis that is easier to perform even by any person without medical/laboratory capacity, and have a very good sensitivity and specificity.

## Objective
To develop robust algorithm to detect eggs of parasitic worms in a variety of microscopic images that is easier to perform even by any person without medical/laboratory capacity, and have a very good sensitivity and specificity. 

## Data Collection & Preparation
Dataset taken from : 
[Parasitic Egg Detection and Classification in Microscopic Images(ieee-dataport.org)](https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/parasitic-egg-detection-and-classification-microscopic-images#files)

Dataset contain 11 parasitic egg types, each has 1,000 images :
category 0: Ascaris lumbricoides
category 1: Capillaria philippinensis
category 2: Enterobius vermicularis
category 3: Fasciolopsis buski
category 4: Hookworm egg
category 5: Hymenolepis diminuta
category 6: Hymenolepis nana
category 7: Opisthorchis viverrine
category 8: Paragonimus spp
category 9: Taenia spp. egg
category 10: Trichuris trichiura
Annotation Format : COCO JSON

## Data Preprocessing
Dataset comes with default preprocessed images :

Apply Gaussian blur with a standard deviation between 0.0 - 3.0
Crop each side by a random value from 0 to 30%
Apply motion blur (10% of total images) with a random kernel size of 3- 35 pixels and orientation of 0-360 degree
Apply Gaussian noise with a standard deviation between 0.0 - 25.5 (to each colour channel separately)
Apply Poisson noise with a lambda (the expected rate of occurrences) between 0.0 - 5.0
Adjust image saturation by adding a value in a range of -25 - +25 to the S channel of the HSV colour space
Adjust contrast using gamma correction with a gamma value between 0.5 - 2.0
