# Parasitic_Egg_Multiclass_Object_Detection_and_Counting_in_Microscopic_Images

## Background & Problem Statement
Parasitic infections have been recognized as one of the most significant causes of illnesses by WHO. Diarrheal disease, which is often caused by parasitic infection is the TOP 5 leading cause of children death in low-income countries.

Diagnosis of intestinal parasites is usually based on direct microscopic examination, which require trained/skilled personnel that often lacking in remote region.

THAT IS WHY we need a new tool for diagnosis that is easier to perform even by any person without medical/laboratory capacity, and have a very good sensitivity and specificity.
